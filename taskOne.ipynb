            "['Email : Elizabeth, please call me to let me know how you want to proceed on this.I reviewed with Mary last week the set-of language for the trading forms in light of Robert Anderson\\'s review and suggested revisions.Mary had reviewed the language with your outside counsel and for reasons, most of which I did not necessarily follow to be honest, they were not agreeable to Robert\\'s suggested revisions (other than the \"without limitation\" language (which I note has now been inserted only in part, and therefore may still problematic, in that it refers to being without limitation to either party\\'s rights, which would include the defaulting party\\'s right to object to the enforceability of the entire set-off provision or to assert some alternate form of set-off arrangement)).I agreed with Mary that I would again review that matter with Robert.I have again reviewed the matter with Robert, and he remains concerned with the language as is, since the triangular set-off as proposed without also dealing with the issue of mutuality, which is fundamental to the concept of set-off, results in a contractual agreement (assuming that we get past the privity and consideration issues), to call something \"set-off\" that fundamentally is not set-off.Robert\\'s concern is that if the issue of mutuality is not addressed the current language could be viewed by a court not as set-off but as an assignment of a third obligation as security, that may be unenforceable for various reasons, including non-perfection.Robert also makes the following points:  1.His suggested revisions already are a compromise from what he believes would be required in a more detailed provision addressing these complex issues;  2.To the extent that we introduce triangular set-off that may not ultimately be enforceable, we are running the risk of the entire clause not be allowed by the courts, and therefore having no right to set-off;  3.As drafting points, the \"without limitation\" language still provides the defaulting party with an argument to avoid the entire arrangement, and there is no specified date for the currency conversion;  4.In terms of the issue of consideration, it is an issue of contract formation, which is fundamental to a contractual right of set-off;  5.In terms of when the mutuality of the obligations arises, he is agrees that it would be best that it arise form inception, but he thought that would be difficult to sell commercially, and therefore setled on default but prior to elected termination.In short, Robert\\'s point is that even with his revisions he would have concerns, but without his revisions he has serious concerns around enforceability, and it is difficult for me to simply ignore his advice given both his reasoning and my experience with Robert\\'s advice.In terms of where to go, I think there are the following solutions:  1.We can see this as a Canadian issue, and therefore incorporate Robert\\'s changes in the Canadian forms only - physical and financial;  2.We can have Robert speak to your outside counsel and see if they can\\'t come to some common ground on more universal language;  3.We can leave the matter as is for all forms.(I am more comfortable with 1 than 3.)Why don\\'t you give me a call.I am sure we all want to move past this and, ackowledginging the risks, simply need to agree on a definitive approach.Peter.

            "['Email : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ?Several procedural scenarios that might play out regarding the Edison MOU.?A snapshot analysis of the political dynamics that affect the outcome.Procedural Scenarios   Assembly  The Assembly Appropriations Committee\\'s plan to take up SB 78XX today will likely be a pro forma hearing moving the bill forward to the full Assembly on a party line vote.While the controversial land easements amendments had been removed as of Friday\\'s draft bill, it is rumored that the amendments may have returned over the weekend.If the problematic \"Shaver Lake\" provisions are removed from the bill, Assembly members may not hear much vocal public opposition from their constituents about rejecting the bill (although consumer groups are opposed and are trying to generate grass roots opposition).If the Shaver Lake amendments remain, several Central Valley legislators may oppose the plan in committee.Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg supports this Edison deal, and the business community supports some recent amendments.This likely mitigates concerns from other pro-business Democrats.With or without the Shaver Lake provisions, Hertzberg should get at least 41 Democratic members (and probably a few more), but no more than 2 Republicans (if any) to vote Aye on the bill.Hertzberg has more than enough votes to spare from his caucus - he needs 41 votes for the bill to pass, and there are 50 Democrats in his caucus.If the vote is close, a personal plea from him and/or the Governor should enable him to get to 41.Senate  The bill would next move to the Senate for approval of the Assembly\\'s amendments.This is where the prognosticating gets difficult.Senate President pro Tem John Burton has said he does not support any amendments to SB 78xx.Gov.Davis and Speaker Hertzberg will likely meet several times with Burton to try to cut a deal, but relations between Davis and Burton are currently frayed (due to a variety of factors), and Burton is not one to back down from a position unless there is something in it for him to change his position.This would lead to one of four scenarios:  ?Burton refuses to have the bill heard in the Senate, and no Edison MOU bill is approved before Sept. 15th,  ?Burton agrees to let the bill be heard despite his opposition (this option is unlikely),  ?Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg and brings the bill (as it is passed by the Assembly) for a         vote in the full Senate with his support, ?Burton comes to a deal with Davis and Hertzberg, but as part of the deal, he insists on changes in the bill - thereby sending it back to the Assembly for more amendments, and another vote in the Assembly - before a vote in the Senate.John Burton is considered one of the smartest, and certainly the cleverest politician in California state government today, so it is problematic to guess his next move.Additionally, external factors play into the determination of which of these options will result.For instance, the Governor may be willing to cut a deal with Burton on an unrelated issue that Burton cares more about resolving his way (e.g.workers compensation benefits, drug courts, reapportionment).Foretelling what will happen in the Senate is extremely difficult.But Davis and Hertzberg will try to cut a deal with him, and given Burton\\'s past actions, he may string them along, holding out for several days (maybe even until Sept. 14th) before he agrees to anything.Governor  Assuming the bill escapes the Senate (and more deals may need to be cut to get enough votes) the Governor will almost certainly sign it, regardless of Edison\\'s public position.The bill will go into effect 90 days after the Governor signs it.Consumer groups have vowed to undo any \"Edison bailout\" enacted into law by way of the ballot box.That could be either (1) an initiative to pass another bill overturning SB 78xx and replacing it with other provisions, or (2) a referendum to repeal SB 78xx, making it as if the bill was never passed at all.Initiative  Once drafted and submitted to the Attorney General, it takes 15 days to receive an official title and summary, and another 25 days if the AG determines that a fiscal estimate is necessary.After either the 15 or 40 days, the Attorney General sends it to the proponents, the Senate, the Assembly, and the Secretary of State.The day it is mailed is called the Summary Date.That is the day upon which all calculations are made.The proponents are allowed a maximum of 150 days to circulate petitions and collect signatures.However, the initiative measure must qualify at least 131 days before the statewide election in which it is to be submitted to the voters.Therefore it is past the deadline to qualify for the next statewide election, on March 5, 2002 (statewide primaries), and so, could not qualify until the statewide general election on November 5, 2002.However the window is tight for that election, as well, and a proposal would need to be submitted to the Attorney General by the end of September 2001 to qualify for November 2002.The legislature may conduct public hearings on the proposed initiative, but cannot amend it.So whatever is submitted is what goes on the ballot.An initiative requires the gathering of signatures equal to five percent of the total votes cast for Governor in the preceding gubernatorial election (419,260 signatures).The ability to collect signature is heavily dependent on the amount of money the proponents have to pay signature gatherers.It seems unlikely that the consumer groups will be able to raise that kind of money quickly, but Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights has been successful at placing pro-consumer initiatives on the ballot before, including Prop.9 in 1998, which sought to undo AB 1890 before the public understood its ramifications.Referendum  Referenda on the ballot are fairly rare in comparison to initiatives, although a successful referendum was on the March 7, 2000 ballot.Prior to that, the last four questions placed before the voters appeared on the June 1982 primary election ballot.All four were defeated.Since 1912, there have been approximately 50 attempts to qualify referenda for the ballot.Of the 50 attempts, 39 qualified for the ballot, 26 of which prevented legislative statutes from taking effect.The circulation calendar, verification, timing, and the form of petition have different requirements than initiatives.For example, the California Constitution requires that the process must be completed within ninety days of the enactment of the bill that is being referred.The signature requirements are the same for a referendum as an initiative statute, though.Political Dynamics  Notwithstanding the Governor\\'s and Assembly Speaker\\'s desire to enact an Edison rescue package, Senate President pro tem John Burton is in the driver\\'s seat.In fact, as noted above, there is a perception among some that it is the Governor who needs Burton and not the other way around.One business source close to the negotiations believes Burton is not inclined to ask his members to make a second vote for an Edison bailout.In fact, members of both houses are worried about being perceived as bailing out the hobbled utility, their reluctance fed by generators\\' lobbyists who are sharing survey data that indicates voters blame the utilities for the energy mess and oppose any bailout.Currently, due largely to this dynamic and others such as the Shaver Lake issue, there are not 41 votes for an Edison rescue in the Assembly.We believe this will change as the Governor and the Speaker exert their influence, and the bill will pass the Assembly.As difficult as it is to make predictions regarding the Assembly, the state Senate presents an even larger challenge.However, at this point it is our opinion that the odds of an Edison rescue package being approved by the state Senate are less than 50 percent.

JENKINS, JR.The big news this summer is that Californians haven\\'t been reduced to stone-age lifestyles, running naked in the streets and eating each other.The state barely had enough electricity to get through this past winter, when demand was not yet pumped up with air-conditioning.Yet here they are surviving the summer with nary a blackout.Gov.Gray Davis must be some kind of a wizard, pulling 15,000 megawatts from his pointy hat.He gave every indication of being a hapless cluck, but obviously we underestimated him.Naah.California\\'s summer of surplus demonstrates just how flukey last winter\\'s rolling blackouts were.Power there was aplenty (or at least enough to get by).What there wasn\\'t was anybody to pay for it, thanks to the political system\\'s paralysis as the state\\'s private utilities ran out of cash and used up their credit trying to keep the lights on.We won\\'t rehearse the central pinion of this catastrophe, a \"deregulation\" plan that created scarcity pricing in the absence of true scarcity.A tweak here and there as late as last fall could have saved the state\\'s taxpayers and ratepayers literally billions of dollars at no real cost to anybody.Instead, the utilities were allowed simply to run out of money, accumulating $14 billion in unpayable IOUs to generators.Now, most of us tend to think of power plants as giant coal or nuclear operations that run 24 hours a day, supplying \"baseload\" power.But the majority of plants are part-timers, firing up to meet intermediate and peak demand.Revving up their turbines means incurring fuel, labor and maintenance costs, which means operators like to get paid.The crisis months saw three distinct waves of blackouts, each related to plants dropping off line simply because they feared not getting paid.In January, it was British Columbia Hydro, the big, government-owned operator of Canadian dams, which had kept California afloat on credit for months.In March it was dozens of small California generators, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" which no longer could meet their own fuel and labor bills because they weren\\'t getting paid by their utility customers.In July, it was the federal government imposing impenetrably complex price controls across the West, making it impossible for generators to know what price they were allowed to charge.Some shut down rather than take a chance, and since the federal intervention meant the entire region was on the griddle for California\\'s mismanagement, the blackouts just happened to land in Nevada.There was no shortage, in other words, no \"energy crisis.\"There was only the unaddressed credit problems of the utilities.We opined in January that Californians would be surprised at how quickly power prices return to normal.Yup.The state threw open the treasury to pay for the power the utilities could no longer afford and suddenly sellers were everywhere and prices fell.In the teeth of peak air-conditioning season, electricity prices are now back to normal.In retrospect, what\\'s amazing is that so many plants not only kept operating month after month despite being stiffed by the state, but produced 62% more power than they had the year before to keep California lit.Yet they\\'ve gotten nothing but abuse from the governor, who is still turning over every legal stone to try to avoid paying the IOUs.There is no question that Western supplies were tighter than usual thanks to low water levels in Northwest river systems.But the evidence shows that Western markets were flexible enough to accommodate the glitches.All they needed was a creditworthy customer to deal with.

Do you know about that?If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.Let me know your thoughts on this.Michelle \", 'Dynegy Request ann0 : dynegy / enron transfers ann1 : protocol for hiring dynegy employees ann2 : protocol for hiring employees from dynegy\\n']\n",

            "['Email : Dear Ken, I apologize for bothering you with this kind of a nuisance, however I hope  you can help my friend.I called you a year ago about  problems dealing with the Houston Pipeline group.I am appealing to you again.I was contacted to provide nitrogen gas for a  pipeline pigging project last year on a 20\" line that goes south from Corpus  Christi.Rusty Bellflower told me I was  going to provide the nitrogen and then after my group was mobilized on short  notice over a weekend, they cancelled - did not even call us, just never called  back.I spent a week on the project and my subcontractor was out his  mobilization cost, and after more than a year, they finally paid a part of our  cost.During the negotiation for the nitrogen set up, I  visited the pipeline site, and saw some oil on the ground.I mentioned to the  HPL rep Rusty Bellflower, that I had a biological product that is excellent for  eliminating oil.He called in a big rush on a Friday afternoon and said for me  to hot shot 10 or so drums of the stuff to a site on the beach (10 pigs or  something) where they would put the chemical into the 20\" pipeline.He even gave  me a PO number (X000496) A week later he called and said they decided not to use  the chemical.I told him we were going to charge for restocking and the cost for  hot shot services.Rusty said that if we charged them anything we  could be sure that we would never work for HPL or Enron again.That is my experience with HPL.Now my friend Jay Pope with Coastline Resources is  also having trouble on his part of the pipeline work.Nick Cocavessis of HPL  contacted Jay and asked Jay to bid the pigging job.A few things went wrong, but  most of them were a result of bad decisions on the part of the HPL personnel.Why did they call a small outfit like Coastline in the first place?It looks  like they called them so they could muscle them around at the end of the job.Jay Pope has been able to reduce the balance due to the subcontractors to  $2,780,000.Enron is offering $2,550,000.Enron attorney (Andy  Edison) said \"Tell Jay he\\'ll just have to chiselanother $ 230,000.00 out  of the sub\\'s\"   I am a stockholder in Enron, but I do not see the  sense in beating up contractors.Is there anything you can do to get the old HPL  group to settle with Jay?Thank you for looking at this.

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This article was originally published earlier Friday.)LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Department of Water Resources, the agency purchasing a bulk of the state\\'s power needs in lieu of the three investor-owned utilities, is expected to tell state regulators Friday that they need to increase electricity rates by as much as 25%.This is because there are insufficient funds in the current revenue stream to cover a $13.4 billion bond sale, three commissioners with the Public Utilities Commission told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday.PUC President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue a draft decision Friday either endorsing the rate hike request or calling for an audit of the DWR\\'s current revenue stream before she makes a decision, aides in her office said.If the PUC determines that there are not enough funds in the current rate structure to cover the bond sale, it will have no choice but to order the rate increase, according to the legislation that put the state in the power buying business.Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase, the second in just two months, if approved by the PUC, the commissioners said.\"Back in May when we ordered the first rate increase, we said we may be forced to do it again by the summer,\" one commissioner said.\"It\\'s unfortunate, but it shouldn\\'t be a shock to anyone.The state has made an enormous commitment to Wall Street that rates would go up whenever it\\'s needed to ensure there is enough money to pay off those bonds.\"Lynch and a spokesman for the DWR were unavailable for comment late Thursday.Separately, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has drafted a proposal expected to be introduced into the Assembly Friday or Saturday that would have large businesses using the most electricity to finance the bulk of the $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts, aides in his office said.Moreover, Keeley\\'s plan is aimed at reducing rates for consumers who use the least amount of power.Details of the plan are still sketchy, aides said.Possible Rate Hike To Generate $2.5B Yearly For State  The 50% rate increase ordered in May is expected to generate $5 billion annually, and if the PUC orders a 25% increase, that is expected to generate $2.5 billion.However, it is still unclear if that is enough, the commissioners said.Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase, the second in four months, if approved by the PUC, the three commissioners said.Since January, the state has spent nearly $8.5 billion buying electricity on behalf of customers of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric.The state has borrowed more than $7 billion from its general fund, which must be repaid by ratepayers at 6% interest, to purchase power.In addition, the state has locked itself into $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts at high prices for as much as 20 years to ensure there is enough power to meet demand.Future rate increases to finance the contracts are likely, state officials have said.But if the PUC orders another rate increase, the money won\\'t benefit the utilities, which have billions of dollars in power costs to recover.Instead, it will be used to guarantee Wall Street financial institutions that there is sufficient funds in the rate structure to allow $13.4 billion in revenue bonds to be sold.The bonds are expected to be sold in August or September, said state Treasurer Phil Angelides.The commissioners said the PUC and the DWR waited to address another rate hike to see if state officials and generators were successful in coming to terms on $8.9 billion the state says it was overcharged for power since last year.After two weeks of hearings between generators and a delegation of California utility executives and energy officials, talks broke down Monday.Generators offered the state $716 million in refunds, but Gov.Gray Davis balked, threatening to sue to recover the full $8.9 billion.Any refunds would have been disbursed to the utilities and the DWR, which could have deferred the need for any rate increase, according to Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis.An administrative law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Thursday he will recommend that the commission not order cash refunds to California because the state\\'s utilities owe far more money to the generators than what he thinks the state is owed.

(FEIN: not listed) 2000 - Harrier Power Corporation (FEIN: not listed)  Please complete the attached questionnaire for each acquisition with as much information as possible.If the acquisition did not involve employees, just complete the top portion of the questionnaire and answer questions 1 and 2.In reference to question 5, since it is unlikely that you have access to such detailed payroll information, if you could provide the states in which the predecessor had employment, we will then be in a position to contact state agencies to gather more detailed information.Thank you for your assistance in this process.If you have any questions, please call me at (713) 237-5346 or Janice at x37839.Once the questionnaires have been completed, please return them to me via e-mail at alexa.r.cutter@us.andersen.com.Sincerely, ', 'Employment Tax Refund Project ann0 : information needed for tax refund project ann1 : questionnaire for significant employee tax refund ann2 : significant employment tax refund project\\n']\n",

            "[\"Email : CLFP proposes the following changes to medium and large commercial and industrial customer tariffs for electric service provided by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company.CLFP proposes the Commission establish an optional summer on-peak, peak period consisting of a continuous 3-hour period during the current summer on-peak period for both utilities.The 3-hour period would be selected by the customer.Specifically:   Service Eligibility:  Customers served as medium or large commercial/industrial customers on time-of-use rates and metered accordingly.Examples - PG&E's E-19, E-20, etc.and SCE's TOU-8, etc.Customer Eligibility:  Electric customers processing, handling, distributing or processing perishable food and agriculture products.(As noted below, since no revenue shift occurs within the class, the Commission may consider opening the option to others.)Customer Charge Surcharge:  A surcharge of $130 per meter per month for the initial summer period (2001) to offset the utilities cost for changes to billing procedures.In the case of optimal billing period service customers the surcharge shall correspond with such billing period.Optional Summer On-Peak Period:  Any continuous 3-hour period during the summer-on-peak period of time.Hours may be designated by the customer consistent with metering capabilities of the customer or changes to metering capability.The reason for designation by the food processor or agriculture commodity processing customer is in order to take into account the many factors involved in load shedding.Labor, harvesting schedules and coordination with growers, delivery schedules, inspection activity, etc.All bear upon such an effort.Rate for Optional Summer-On-Peak Period Service:  Energy rates for the 3-hour period would be two times the otherwise applicable charge for summer-on-peak energy.The other 3 hours of the 6-hour on-peak period would be billed at the non-peak rate and equalized for rate/revenue neutrality.In the event partial peak periods are retained, the rate for the non-optioned 3-hour period during the on-peak period would be adjusted to retain revenue neutrality.These rates would apply, as now, workdays of Monday - Friday.Notice and Service:  An eligible customer must notify the utility in writing, by fax, email, or hand delivered, to both the appropriate account representative and the customer billing department of the request for optional summer-on-peak period service.The 3-hour period of optional service and the start date for such service shall be specified.Start dates should coincide with billing cycles, with a minimum of seven days notice prior to such cycle.Optional optimal billing period customers would be treated accordingly, except as currently provided, a two-day advance notice.Implementation Issues - TOU Meters and Billing.It appears the number of customer meters and billing changes potentially required by optional summer on-peak period service is relatively small compared to the total number of meters of the utilities.In response to CLFP's data request by PG&E and SCE (attached) the following is observed.For SCE, SIC 20 (food and kindred products) customers account for approximately 163 meters out of about 10,000 meters.Of the 163, all but 8 can be managed locally by the Customer Data Acquisition System.The 8 would appear to require a field visit.For PG&E, out of 11,675 TOU meters on E-19 and E-20 service, 354 or 3% of the total are SIC 20.Of the 354 nearly half, 175, are hourly interval meters.The remaining 179 presumably would need a field visit for reprogramming.Conclusion:  Based upon the data supplied, metering and billing changes required by an optional summer on-peak period program for processors of perishable commodities, there does not seem, in CLFP's opinion, to be a significant barrier to establishing the program. \", 'Synopsis of (Ag) Food Processors Rate Design Proposal ann0 : regarding the optional summer on-peak period program ann1 : moving forwarding with metering & billing changes - details !!!! ann2 : customer tariffs for electric service\\n']\n",

            "[\"Email : With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us.While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees. \", \"Management Changes ann0 : moving forward after ken lay's resignation ann1 : enron's management structure and what lies ahead ann2 : enron's management  changes\\n\"]\n",

Dividend payouts on SoCal common stock will be subject to CPUC approval during this extension.?100% of any revenue SoCal receives/generates from FERC/generator refunds will be applied to SoCal\\'s debt.?Once SoCal\\'s back debt has been recovered, any surplus revenue generated from the CPUC rate hikes will be refunded to ratepayers.CPUC - DWR Rate Agreement The fact that the PUC voted down the DWR rate agreement (by a 4-1 margin) puts Governor Davis and Treasurer Angelides in a very awkward position.This leaves Senator Burton\\'s bill, SB 18XX, as the vehicle that sets to payment path for the revenue bonds to repay the General Fund.However, as late as this morning, Governor Davis vowed (through his spokesman) that SB 18XX was \"dead on arrival\" and would be vetoed.This move by the PUC puts pressure on Davis to sign SB 18XX in order to protect the bonds and the long-term power contacts he has negotiated.However, 18XX violates the terms of a number of the long-term power contacts negotiated by the governor earlier this year.For example:   ?SB 18XX splits the revenue streams for payment of the General Fund\\'s revenue bonds and payment to the DWR for power.It clarifies the funds that will go to repay the General Fund, but is much less clear on the funds to pay the DWR for power.SB 18XX leaves the long-term contracts signed by the governor open to review and renegotiation - something that the governor remains publicly unwilling to do.?SB 18XX also violates the terms of the bridge loan the state negotiated with Shearson Lehman earlier this year.The terms of the bridge loan explicitly state that if 18XX is passed, the banks can accelerate the loan or impose penalty terms of interest on the state.These terms were suggested by the governor as a means of forcing the legislature to support his DWR rate agreement rather than Burton\\'s.Of course, this effort failed when the legislature easily passed SB 18XX.Today\\'s PUC action further complicates the situation.While on the surface this would seem to force the governor\\'s hand into signing SB 18XX, that may not, in fact, happen.It would not be out of character for the governor to instead veto SB 18XX, then force either the legislature or the PUC to \"play ball\" with him in order to repay the General Fund.Thus, another leverage point has been created.We will continue to monitor the situation to attempt to determine the likelihood of Davis signing or vetoing SB 18XX.

            "[\"Email : As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).Thank you for your help in this matter. \", \"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues ann0 : procedure prior to enron merger ann1 : in light of antitrust laws, initial procedures in dealing with dynergy ann2 : here's what's happening with dynegy's enron acquisition\\n\"]\n",

This is a rough era for American business icons.Subject to the vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business.The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest.The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage.We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed.High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms.But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value. \", 'What Enron Did Right ann0 : editorial in the wall street journal ann1 : great wall street journal editorial ann2 : wall street journal editorial\\n']\n",

            "[\"Email : Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air  Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1  C/S which occurred in 1996.Transwestern had met with the AQB over this  issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further  actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was  received.The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of  interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing  smaller turbine (3505).The larger internal components  (inlet guide  vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to  simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.When Transwestern received  permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity,  Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher  turbine value 4700.The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not  make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by  Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.Only Solar is  authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.This prevents Transwestern  from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this  turbine at their descretion.In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a  emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than  the permitted values for the 3505.It was shown that emissions from the 4700  were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.It should also be  mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple  cycle.Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to  be outstanding as determined by the EPA.Dave Nutt has been sent the  Compliance Order to review.Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern  has 30 days to request another hearing.Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and  handle this issue.Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a  conference call for sometime next week? \", 'Compliance Order, P-1 C/S ann0 : conference call requested on status of nm aqb compliance order, permits issue ann1 : meeting re: transwestern compliance order ann2 : turbine replacement\\n']\n",
